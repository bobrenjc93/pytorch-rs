r"""
This package adds support for CUDA tensor types.

It implements the same function as CPU tensors, but they utilize
GPUs for computation.

It is lazily initialized, so you can always import it, and use
:func:`is_available()` to determine if your system supports CUDA.

:ref:`cuda-semantics` has more details about working with CUDA.

    Return a bool indicating if CUDA is currently available.

        ``PYTORCH_NVML_BASED_CUDA_CHECK=1`` is set. For more details, see
        :ref:`multiprocessing-poison-fork-note`.

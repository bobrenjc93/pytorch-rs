    By default, this returns the peak allocated memory since the beginning of

    reset the starting point in tracking this metric. For example, these two
    functions can measure the peak allocated memory usage of each iteration in a
    training loop.

        device (torch.device or int, optional): selected device. Returns
            statistic for the current device, given by :func:`~torch.cuda.current_device`,
            if :attr:`device` is ``None`` (default).

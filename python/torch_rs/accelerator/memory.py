def memory_stats(

) -> _OrderedDict[str, _Any]:
    r"""Return a dictionary of accelerator device memory allocator statistics for a given device index.

    The return value of this function is a dictionary of statistics, each of
    which is a non-negative integer.

    Core statistics:

    - ``"allocated.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"``:
      number of allocation requests received by the memory allocator.
    - ``"allocated_bytes.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"``:
      amount of allocated memory.
    - ``"segment.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"``:
      number of reserved segments from device memory allocation.
    - ``"reserved_bytes.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"``:
      amount of reserved memory.
    - ``"active.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"``:
      number of active memory blocks.
    - ``"active_bytes.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"``:
      amount of active memory.
    - ``"inactive_split.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"``:
      number of inactive, non-releasable memory blocks.
    - ``"inactive_split_bytes.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"``:
      amount of inactive, non-releasable memory.

    For these core statistics, values are broken down as follows.

    Pool type:

    - ``all``: combined statistics across all memory pools.
    - ``large_pool``: statistics for the large allocation pool
      (as of June 2025, for size >= 1MB allocations).
    - ``small_pool``: statistics for the small allocation pool
      (as of June 2025, for size < 1MB allocations).

    Metric type:

    - ``current``: current value of this metric.
    - ``peak``: maximum value of this metric.
    - ``allocated``: historical total increase in this metric.
    - ``freed``: historical total decrease in this metric.

    In addition to the core statistics, we also provide some simple event
    counters:

    - ``"num_alloc_retries"``: number of failed device memory allocation calls that
      result in a cache flush and retry.
    - ``"num_ooms"``: number of out-of-memory errors thrown.
    - ``"num_sync_all_streams"``: number of ``synchronize_and_free_events`` calls.
    - ``"num_device_alloc"``: number of device memory allocation calls.
    - ``"num_device_free"``: number of device memory free calls.

    Args:
        device_index (:class:`torch.device`, str, int, optional): the index of the device to target.
            If not given, use :func:`torch.accelerator.current_device_index` by default.
            If a :class:`torch.device` or str is provided, its type must match the current
            :ref:`accelerator<accelerators>` device type.

    Returns:
        OrderedDict[str, Any]: an ordered dictionary mapping statistic names to their values.

def is_compiling() -> bool:

    Indicates whether a graph is executed/traced as part of torch.compile() or torch.export().

    Note that there are 2 other related flags that should deprecated eventually:
      * torch._dynamo.external_utils.is_compiling()
      * torch._utils.is_compiling()

    Indicates whether a graph is traced via TorchDynamo.

    It's stricter than is_compiling() flag, as it would only be set to True when
    TorchDynamo is used.

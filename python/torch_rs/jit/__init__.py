def annotate(the_type, the_value):
    """Use to give type of `the_value` in TorchScript compiler.

    .. deprecated:: 2.5
        TorchScript is deprecated, please use ``torch.compile`` instead.

    This method is a pass-through function that returns `the_value`, used to hint TorchScript
    compiler the type of `the_value`. It is a no-op when running outside of TorchScript.

    Though TorchScript can infer correct type for most Python expressions, there are some cases where
    type inference can be wrong, including:

    - Empty containers like `[]` and `{}`, which TorchScript assumes to be container of `Tensor`
    - Optional types like `Optional[T]` but assigned a valid value of type `T`, TorchScript would assume
      it is type `T` rather than `Optional[T]`

    Note that `annotate()` does not help in `__init__` method of `torch.nn.Module` subclasses because it
    is executed in eager mode. To annotate types of `torch.nn.Module` attributes,
    use :meth:`~torch.jit.Attribute` instead.

    Example:

    .. testcode::

        import torch
        from typing import Dict

        @torch.jit.script
        def fn():
            # Telling TorchScript that this empty dictionary is a (str -> int) dictionary
            # instead of default dictionary type of (str -> Tensor).
            d = torch.jit.annotate(Dict[str, int], {})

            # Without `torch.jit.annotate` above, following statement would fail because of
            # type mismatch.
            d["name"] = 20

    .. testcleanup::

        del fn

    Args:
        the_type: Python type that should be passed to TorchScript compiler as type hint for `the_value`
        the_value: Value or expression to hint type for.

    Returns:
        `the_value` is passed back as return value.
    """
    return the_value


def script_if_tracing(fn):
    """
    Compiles ``fn`` when it is first called during tracing.

    .. deprecated:: 2.5
        TorchScript is deprecated, please use ``torch.compile`` instead.

    ``torch.jit.script`` has a non-negligible start up time when it is first called due to
    lazy-initializations of many compiler builtins. Therefore you should not use
    it in library code. However, you may want to have parts of your library work
    in tracing even if they use control flow. In these cases, you should use
    ``@torch.jit.script_if_tracing`` to substitute for
    ``torch.jit.script``.

    Args:
        fn: A function to compile.

    Returns:
        If called during tracing, a :class:`ScriptFunction` created by `torch.jit.script` is returned.
        Otherwise, the original function `fn` is returned.
